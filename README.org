I'm Sacha Chua, and here are 
ten Emacs News highlights for 2021.
If you want to follow the links,
check out the wiki page at
https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/news/ .

#+CAPTION: Emacs NEWS.28
[[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_095333.png]]

1. The Emacs developers are currently
   working on [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/NEWS.28][Emacs 28.1]],
   which will be the next major release.

   #+CAPTION: Native compilation featured on System Crafters
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_095812.png]]
   
   Native compilation should
   make everything way faster,

   #+CAPTION: Emoji in NEWS.28
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_100456.png]]

   and emoji support will probably

   #+CAPTION: Emoji character script
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_100414.png]]

   make things more fun. 😎👍
   
   John Wiegley will share more Emacs 28 details
   in his update, so check out his talk.

   #+CAPTION: Org Mode 9.5
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_100623.png]]

2. [[https://orgmode.org/Changes.html][Org Mode is now at version 9.5]].
   New features include
   a library for [[https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-07-31-citations.html#fn.3][managing citations]],
   
   [[file:images/org-async-python-demo.mp4]]
   
   [[https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-05-31-async.html][asynchronous session support]]
   for code blocks,

   #+CAPTION: New faces for agenda
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_101636.png]]

   and better control
   of your [[https://orgmode.org/Changes.html][agenda's appearance]].
   
   #+CAPTION: Org Mode 9.5
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_100623.png]]
   If you've been getting your Org packages
   from Org ELPA,
   you can update your configuration
   to get Org from GNU ELPA
   and org-contrib from NonGNU ELPA.

   #+CAPTION: Org Roam v2
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_101756.png]]

   The [[https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/org_roam_v2/][new release of the Org Roam package]] ([[https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-08-38-roaming.html][TMIO]])
   should be a faster and more consistent way
   to use Org to manage a knowledgebase,

   #+CAPTION: Org Roam UI
   [[file:images/org-roam-ui.png]]
   
   and [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui/][org-roam-ui]] looks pretty snazzy.

   #+CAPTION: blog.tecosaur.com/tmio
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_101922.png]]

   The best way to keep up with Org changes
   is to check out the blog [[https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/][This Month in Org]].

3.
   #+CAPTION: Magit 3.0.0 release notes
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_102028.png]]

   New [[https://emacsair.me/2021/05/25/magit-3.0/][Magit major release]], now version 3.3.
   Jonas Bernoulli has split some functionality
   into other packages so that
   Emacs Lisp developers can use them, such as
   magit-section, transient, and forge.

   #+CAPTION: (and Bufler Taxy Magit-Section)
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_102147.png]]

   Here's an example of using magit-section to
   [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pkuwcq/and_bufler_taxy_magitsection_a_concise_language/][manage groups of buffers]].

   #+CAPTION: Self-describing Smart DSLs
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_102242.png]]

   You can learn more about Transient
   in the talk on [[https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/dsl/][self-describing 
   smart domain-specific languages]] or DSLs.
   
4. In terms of smaller packages, there's been
   a lot of activity around completion.
   I think the idea is that instead of having
   one large completion system
   like Helm or Icicles, you can choose
   a few different, smaller packages
   and configure them to work together.
   If you're curious about this, 
   you might start with either
     
     #+CAPTION: selectrum
     [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_204634.png]]
     [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][selectrum]] 
     #+CAPTION: Vertico
     [[file:images/vertico.svg]]
     or [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]],
     which are both completion interfaces,

     #+CAPTION: marginalia
     [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212130.png]]
     add [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][marginalia]] for more information
        
     #+CAPTION: consult
     [[file:images/consult-grep.gif]]
     and try [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] for many useful
     completing commands.
     
   #+CAPTION: Discussion on completion frameworks
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212308.png]]

   There are so many options, 
   so it might be useful to check out
   [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ppg98f/which_completion_framework_do_you_use_and_why/][some discussions]].
5. 
   #+CAPTION: Embark
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212456.png]]
   [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]] is usually mentioned as part of  
   that group of packages, 
   but it's well worth looking into
   even if you use a different system. 
   It lets you choose an action 
   based on an object, which is handy for 
   when you start with one command 
   and then realize that 
   you actually want to do something else. 
   #+CAPTION: Fifteen ways to use Embark
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212529.png]]
   For more ideas, check out 
   [[https://karthinks.com/software/fifteen-ways-to-use-embark/][Fifteen Ways to Use Embark]].
6. Now that there are Emacs Lisp bindings 
   for tree-sitter, we can work more easily
   with the structure of code instead of 
   just using regular expressions. 
   You can use tree-sitter for
   #+CAPTION: treesitter-powered snippets
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212756.png]]
   [[https://blog.meain.io/2021/intelligent-snippets-treesitter/][intelligent snippets]] that get information 
   from the code around them,
   #+CAPTION: symex-ts
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_213017.png]]
   [[https://github.com/polaris64/symex-ts][editing Lisp expressions]], 
   #+CAPTION: evil-textobj
   [[file:images/evil-textobj.gif]]
   and [[https://github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter][navigating text objects in Evil mode.]] 
   (That's when Emacs is pretending to be Vi.) 
   Dynamic modules help us add more to Emacs 
   than Emacs Lisp easily offers,
   #+CAPTION: GopCaml
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_213235.png]]
   such as [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KipRuiLXYEo][structural editing in OCaml]]
   #+CAPTION: parinfer-rust
   [[file:images/parinfer-rust.gif]]
   and [[https://github.com/justinbarclay/parinfer-rust-mode#installing][using Rust to figure out parentheses]]
   and indentation for Lisp.
   #+CAPTION: Extending Emacs in Rust with Dynamic Modules
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_213423.png]]
   If you're curious about dynamic modules,
   check out the talk on
   [[https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/rust/][Extending Emacs in Rust with Dynamic Modules]].
7. 
   #+CAPTION: CRDT - collaborative editing
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_213543.png]]
   Collaborative editing is now much easier 
   since the [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/crdt.html][CRDT]] package is in GNU ELPA. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pdi08v/crdtel_the_collaborative_editing_package_now_on/][Reddit]]) 
   It allows multiple people to edit 
   the same file over the network, 
   using their own Emacs. 
   This means you can keep your own config
   and keybindings, yay! 
   #+CAPTION: Emacs Research Group
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_213619.png]]
   Watch the [[https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/erg/][Emacs Research Group talk]] 
   for an example of how several people 
   used it to work together.
8. In case you're still under the impression 
   that Emacs is just a text editor, 
   some folks have been working on 
   pretty neat graphical experiments.
   #+CAPTION: OpenGL
   [[file:images/opengl.png]]
   These [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/kn3fzq/draw_anything_to_emacs_buffers_with_opengl/][OpenGL bindings for Emacs Lisp]] 
   use an embedded xwidget,
   while other prototypes use the SVG support
   that's built into Emacs
   #+CAPTION: Gantt charts
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_214059.png]]
   for [[https://github.com/Aightech/org-gantt-svg][Gantt charts]] ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/prezj6/simple_gantt_chart_from_an_org_todo_list_with_svg/][Reddit]]),
   #+CAPTION: Scribble
   [[file:images/scribble.png]]
   [[https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/2021/08/scribble-notes-in-gnu-emacs.html][scribbles]],
   #+CAPTION: el-easydraw
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_214428.png]]
   and even [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pvtbq5/emacs_drawing_tool/][diagrams]].
   #+CAPTION: el-easydraw color picker
   [[file:images/color-picker-minibuffer.png]]
   The color-picker from that one 
   looks particularly useful for CSS.
   If you want to play around with adding SVGs 
   to your files and interfaces,
   #+CAPTION: svg-icons
   [[file:images/svg-icons.png]]
   [[https://github.com/rougier/emacs-svg-icon][svg icons]]
   #+CAPTION: svg-lib
   [[file:images/svg-lib.png]]
   and [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/svg-lib.html][svg-lib]] 
   might be good places to start. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pyee44/svglib_is_on_elpa/][Reddit]])
   Of course, there's always a place 
   for ASCII art,
   #+CAPTION: boxy-headings
   [[file:images/boxy-headings.gif]]
   especially with the new [[https://gitlab.com/tygrdev/boxy][boxy]] package
   that you can use for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/q2z29f/boxyheadlines_and_orgreal_are_now_on_elpa/][org files]],
   #+CAPTION: boxy-imenu
   [[file:images/boxy-imenu.gif]]
   [[https://gitlab.com/tygrdev/boxy-imenu][imenu navigation]],
   #+CAPTION: org-real
   [[file:images/org-real.gif]]
   and even [[https://gitlab.com/tygrdev/org-real][things in real life]].
9. There have been a lot of great videos 
   and livestreams about Emacs this year.
   #+CAPTION: System Crafters
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211021_002413.png]]
   In addition to the ones from [[https://systemcrafters.cc/][System Crafters]],
   #+CAPTION: Emacs Elements
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211021_002120.png]]
   [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe5excZqMeG1CIW-YhMTCEQ][Emacs Elements]],
   #+CAPTION: Protesilaos Stavrou
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211021_002254.png]]
   and [[https://protesilaos.com/][Protesilaos]] 
   (who has started livestreaming),
   #+CAPTION: John Kitchin
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211021_002218.png]]
   [[https://www.youtube.com/user/jrkitchin][John Kitchin]]
   #+CAPTION: Mike Zamansky
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211021_002452.png]]
   and [[https://cestlaz.github.io/categories/emacs/][Mike Zamansky]] 
   are both back, hooray!
10. 
    #+CAPTION: #emacs
    [[file:images/Screenshot_20211021_002604.png]]
    Lastly, if you want to chat 
    with other Emacs folks
    and get help on Emacs, Org Mode, 
    or other topics, the #emacs and #org-mode
    Internet Relay Chat or IRC channels
    are now on the [[https://libera.chat]] network
    instead of Freenode. ([[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel][EmacsWiki]])

I'm Sacha Chua, and here are 
ten Emacs News highlights for 2021.
If you want to follow the links,
check out the wiki page at
https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/news/ .
1. The Emacs developers are currently
   working on Emacs 28.1,
   which will be the next major release.
   Native compilation should
   make everything way faster,
   and emoji support will probably
   make things more fun. 😎👍
   John Wiegley will share more Emacs 28 details
   in his update, so check out his talk.
2. Org Mode is now at version 9.5.
   New features include
   a library for managing citations,
   asynchronous session support
   for code blocks,
   and better control
   of your agenda's appearance.
   If you've been getting your Org packages
   from Org ELPA,
   you can update your configuration
   to get Org from GNU ELPA
   and org-contrib from NonGNU ELPA.
   The TMIO)
   should be a faster and more consistent way
   to use Org to manage a knowledgebase,
   and org-roam-ui looks pretty snazzy.
   The best way to keep up with Org changes
   is to check out the blog This Month in Org.
3.
   New Magit major release, now version 3.3.
   Jonas Bernoulli has split some functionality
   into other packages so that
   Emacs Lisp developers can use them, such as
   magit-section, transient, and forge.
   Here's an example of using magit-section to
   manage groups of buffers.
   You can learn more about Transient
   in the talk on self-describing 
   smart domain-specific languages or DSLs.
4. In terms of smaller packages, there's been
   a lot of activity around completion.
   I think the idea is that instead of having
   one large completion system
   like Helm or Icicles, you can choose
   a few different, smaller packages
   and configure them to work together.
   If you're curious about this, 
   you might start with either
     selectrum 
     or vertico,
     which are both completion interfaces,
     add marginalia for more information
     and try consult for many useful
     completing commands.
   There are so many options, 
   so it might be useful to check out
   some discussions.
5. 
   Embark is usually mentioned as part of  
   that group of packages, 
   but it's well worth looking into
   even if you use a different system. 
   It lets you choose an action 
   based on an object, which is handy for 
   when you start with one command 
   and then realize that 
   you actually want to do something else. 
   For more ideas, check out 
   Fifteen Ways to Use Embark.
6. Now that there are Emacs Lisp bindings 
   for tree-sitter, we can work more easily
   with the structure of code instead of 
   just using regular expressions. 
   You can use tree-sitter for
   intelligent snippets that get information 
   from the code around them,
   editing Lisp expressions, 
   and navigating text objects in Evil mode. 
   (That's when Emacs is pretending to be Vi.) 
   Dynamic modules help us add more to Emacs 
   than Emacs Lisp easily offers,
   such as structural editing in OCaml
   and using Rust to figure out parentheses
   and indentation for Lisp.
   If you're curious about dynamic modules,
   check out the talk on
   Extending Emacs in Rust with Dynamic Modules.
7. 
   Collaborative editing is now much easier 
   since the Reddit) 
   It allows multiple people to edit 
   the same file over the network, 
   using their own Emacs. 
   This means you can keep your own config
   and keybindings, yay! 
   Watch the Emacs Research Group talk 
   for an example of how several people 
   used it to work together.
8. In case you're still under the impression 
   that Emacs is just a text editor, 
   some folks have been working on 
   pretty neat graphical experiments.
   These OpenGL bindings for Emacs Lisp 
   use an embedded xwidget,
   while other prototypes use the SVG support
   that's built into Emacs
   for Reddit),
   scribbles,
   and even diagrams.
   The color-picker from that one 
   looks particularly useful for CSS.
   If you want to play around with adding SVGs 
   to your files and interfaces,
   svg icons
   and svg-lib 
   might be good places to start. (Reddit)
   Of course, there's always a place 
   for ASCII art,
   especially with the new boxy package
   that you can use for org files,
   imenu navigation,
   and even things in real life.
9. There have been a lot of great videos 
   and livestreams about Emacs this year.
   In addition to the ones from System Crafters,
   Emacs Elements,
   and Protesilaos 
   (who has started livestreaming),
   John Kitchin
   and Mike Zamansky 
   are both back, hooray!
10. 
    Lastly, if you want to chat 
    with other Emacs folks
    and get help on Emacs, Org Mode, 
    or other topics, the #emacs and #org-mode
    Internet Relay Chat or IRC channels
    are now on the [[https://libera.chat]] network
    instead of Freenode. (EmacsWiki)

And then afterwards, use subed to play back different options

And then write a tool that will take the vtt and spit out the right ffmpeg command to process the webm with a black screen, audio, and subtitles, and a vtt file that's also trimmed.

And then take the images and drop them in
