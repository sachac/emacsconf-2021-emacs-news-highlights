[[file:images/Screenshot_20211021_002952.png]] 

I'm Sacha Chua, and here are 
ten Emacs News highlights for 2021.
If you want to follow the links,
check out the wiki page at
https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/news/ .

#+CAPTION: 1. Emacs NEWS.28 - git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/NEWS.28
[[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_095333.png]]

1. The Emacs developers are currently
   working on [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/NEWS.28][Emacs 28.1]],
   which will be the next major release.

   #+CAPTION: Native compilation featured on System Crafters, www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8OLg-f9EHk
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_095812.png]]
   
   [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8OLg-f9EHk][Native compilation]] should
   make everything way faster,

   #+CAPTION: Emoji support
   [[file:images/EmacslZhRzr.svg]]

   and emoji support will probably
   make things more fun. 😎👍
   
   John Wiegley will share more Emacs 28 details
   in his update, so check out his talk.

2.
   #+CAPTION: 2. Org Mode 9.5 - orgmode.org/Changes.html
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_100623.png]]

   [[https://orgmode.org/Changes.html][Org Mode is now at version 9.5]].
   New features include
   a library for [[https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-07-31-citations.html#fn.3][managing citations]],

   #+CAPTION: asynchronous session support in Python - blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-05-31-async.html
   [[file:images/org-async-python-demo.mp4]]
   
   [[https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-05-31-async.html][asynchronous session support]]
   for code blocks,

   #+CAPTION: New faces for agenda - orgmode.org/Changes.html
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_101636.png]]

   and better control
   of your [[https://orgmode.org/Changes.html][agenda's appearance]].
   
   #+CAPTION: Org Mode 9.5 - orgmode.org/Changes.html
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_100623.png]]
   If you've been getting your Org packages
   from Org ELPA,
   you can update your configuration
   to get Org from GNU ELPA
   and org-contrib from NonGNU ELPA.

   #+CAPTION: Org Roam v2 - blog.jethro.dev/posts/org_roam_v2/
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_101756.png]]

   The [[https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/org_roam_v2/][new release of the Org Roam package]] ([[https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-08-38-roaming.html][TMIO]])
   should be a faster and more consistent way
   to use Org to manage a knowledgebase,

   #+CAPTION: Org Roam UI - github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui/
   [[file:images/org-roam-ui.png]]
   
   and [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui/][org-roam-ui]] looks pretty snazzy.

   #+CAPTION: blog.tecosaur.com/tmio
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_101922.png]]

   The best way to keep up with Org changes
   is to check out the blog [[https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/][This Month in Org]].

3.
   #+CAPTION: 3. Magit 3 - emacsair.me/2021/05/25/magit-3.0/
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_102028.png]]

   New [[https://emacsair.me/2021/05/25/magit-3.0/][Magit major release]]!
   Jonas Bernoulli has split some functionality
   into other packages so that
   Emacs Lisp developers can use them, such as
   magit-section, transient, and forge.

   #+CAPTION: (and Bufler Taxy Magit-Section) - www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pkuwcq
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_102147.png]]

   Here's an example of using magit-section to
   [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pkuwcq/and_bufler_taxy_magitsection_a_concise_language/][manage groups of buffers]].

   #+CAPTION: Self-describing Smart DSLs - emacsconf.org/2021/talks/dsl/
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_102242.png]]

   You can learn more about Transient
   in the talk on [[https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/dsl/][self-describing 
   smart domain-specific languages]] or DSLs.
   
4. 
   #+CAPTION: 4. Completion - karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/
   [[file:images/minibuffer-interaction-paradigm.png]]
   In terms of smaller packages, there's been
   a lot of activity around completion.
   [[https://karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/][Karthik has a great diagram,]]
   #+CAPTION: Default Emacs completion and extras - https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-01-06-emacs-default-completion/
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211024_165646.png]]
   [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-01-06-emacs-default-completion/][and Prot explains how things work together]].
   I think the idea is that instead of having
   one large completion system
   like Helm or Icicles, you can choose
   a few different, smaller packages
   and configure them to work together.
   If you're curious about this, 
   you might start with either
     
   #+CAPTION: selectrum - github.com/raxod502/selectrum
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_204634.png]]
   [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][selectrum]] 
   #+CAPTION: Vertico - github.com/minad/vertico
   [[file:images/vertico.svg]]
   or [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]],
   which are both completion interfaces,

   #+CAPTION: marginalia - github.com/minad/marginalia
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212130.png]]
   add [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][marginalia]] for more information,

   #+CAPTION: consult - github.com/minad/consult
   [[file:images/consult-grep.gif]]
   and try [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] for many useful
   completing commands.

   #+CAPTION: On completion frameworks - www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ppg98f
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212308.png]]

   There are so many options, 
   so it might be useful to check out
   [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ppg98f/which_completion_framework_do_you_use_and_why/][some discussions]].
5. 
   #+CAPTION: 5. Embark - github.com/oantolin/embark
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212456.png]]
   [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]] is usually mentioned as part of  
   that group of packages, 
   but it's well worth looking into
   even if you use a different system. 
   Embark lets you have context-sensitive shortcuts
   that work on things in buffers, minibuffer content,
   and even collections of things.
   You can also use it
   when you start doing one command
   and then decide to do a different one instead.
   #+CAPTION: Fifteen ways to use Embark - karthinks.com/software/fifteen-ways-to-use-embark/
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212529.png]]

6. 
   #+CAPTION: Tree-sitter-powered editing - https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/structural/
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211022_171008.png]]
   Now that there are Emacs Lisp bindings 
   for tree-sitter, we can work more easily
   with the structure of code instead of 
   just using regular expressions.
   Check out the talk
   on [[https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/structural/][Tree-edit and structural editing]]
   to learn more.
   #+CAPTION: 6. tree-sitter-powered Emacs Lisp - blog.meain.io/2021/intelligent-snippets-treesitter/
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212756.png]]
   You can use tree-sitter for
   [[https://blog.meain.io/2021/intelligent-snippets-treesitter/][intelligent snippets]] that get information 
   from the code around them,
   #+CAPTION: github.com/polaris64/symex-ts
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_213017.png]]
   [[https://github.com/polaris64/symex-ts][editing Lisp expressions]], 
   #+CAPTION: github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter
   [[file:images/evil-textobj.gif]]
   and [[https://github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter][navigating text objects in Evil mode.]] 
   (That's when Emacs is pretending to be Vi.) 
   Dynamic modules help us add more to Emacs 
   than Emacs Lisp easily offers,
   #+CAPTION: GopCaml - www.youtube.com/watch?v=KipRuiLXYEo
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_213235.png]]
   such as [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KipRuiLXYEo][structural editing in OCaml]]
   #+CAPTION: parinfer-rust - github.com/justinbarclay/parinfer-rust-mode
   [[file:images/parinfer-rust.gif]]
   and [[https://github.com/justinbarclay/parinfer-rust-mode#installing][using Rust to figure out parentheses]]
   and indentation for Lisp.
   #+CAPTION: Extending Emacs in Rust with Dynamic Modules - emacsconf.org/2021/talks/rust/
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_213423.png]]
   If you're curious about dynamic modules,
   check out the talk on
   [[https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/rust/][Extending Emacs in Rust with Dynamic Modules]].
7. 
   #+CAPTION: 7. CRDT - collaborative editing - elpa.gnu.org/packages/crdt.html
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_213543.png]]
   Collaborative editing is now much easier 
   since the [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/crdt.html][CRDT]] package is in GNU ELPA. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pdi08v/crdtel_the_collaborative_editing_package_now_on/][Reddit]]) 
   It allows multiple people to edit 
   the same file over the network, 
   using their own Emacs. 
   This means you can keep your own config
   and keybindings, yay! 
   #+CAPTION: Emacs Research Group - emacsconf.org/2021/talks/erg/
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_213619.png]]
   Watch the [[https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/erg/][Emacs Research Group talk]] 
   for an example of how several people 
   used it to work together.
8.
   #+CAPTION: 8. More graphical experiments: OpenGL - www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/kn3fzq
   [[file:images/opengl.png]]
   In case you're still under the impression 
   that Emacs is just a text editor, 
   some folks have been working on 
   pretty neat graphical experiments.
   These [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/kn3fzq/draw_anything_to_emacs_buffers_with_opengl/][OpenGL bindings for Emacs Lisp]] 
   use an embedded xwidget,
   while other prototypes use the SVG support
   that's built into Emacs
   #+CAPTION: Gantt charts - github.com/Aightech/org-gantt-svg
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_214059.png]]
   for [[https://github.com/Aightech/org-gantt-svg][Gantt charts]] ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/prezj6/simple_gantt_chart_from_an_org_todo_list_with_svg/][Reddit]]),

   #+CAPTION: Scribble - lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/2021/08/scribble-notes-in-gnu-emacs.html
   [[file:images/scribble.png]]
   [[https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/2021/08/scribble-notes-in-gnu-emacs.html][scribbles]],
   #+CAPTION: el-easydraw - www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pvtbq5
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_214428.png]]
   and even [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pvtbq5/emacs_drawing_tool/][diagrams]]. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pvtbq5][Reddit]])
   #+CAPTION: el-easydraw color picker - github.com/misohena/el-easydraw
   [[file:images/color-picker-minibuffer.png]]
   The color-picker from that one 
   looks particularly useful for CSS.
   If you want to play around with adding SVGs 
   to your files and interfaces,
   #+CAPTION: svg-icon - github.com/rougier/emacs-svg-icon
   [[file:images/svg-icons.png]]
   [[https://github.com/rougier/emacs-svg-icon][svg icon]]
   #+CAPTION: svg-lib - elpa.gnu.org/packages/svg-lib.html
   [[file:images/svg-lib.png]]
   and [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/svg-lib.html][svg-lib]] 
   might be good places to start. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pyee44/svglib_is_on_elpa/][Reddit]])
   Of course, there's always a place 
   for ASCII art,
   #+CAPTION: boxy-headings - www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/q2z29f
   [[file:images/boxy-headings.gif]]
   especially with the new [[https://gitlab.com/tygrdev/boxy][boxy]] package
   that you can use for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/q2z29f/boxyheadlines_and_orgreal_are_now_on_elpa/][org files]],

    [[file:images/Screenshot_20211021_002604.png]]
    Lastly, if you want to chat 
    with other Emacs folks
    and get help on Emacs, Org Mode, 
    or other topics, the #emacs and #org-mode
    Internet Relay Chat or IRC channels
    are now on the [[https://libera.chat]] network
    instead of Freenode. ([[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel][EmacsWiki]])

   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_100623.png]]
   Org Mode is now at version 9.5.
   New features include
   a library for managing citations,
   #+CAPTION: asynchronous session support in Python - blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-05-31-async.html
   [[file:images/org-async-python-demo.mp4]]
   asynchronous session support
   for code blocks,
   #+CAPTION: New faces for agenda - orgmode.org/Changes.html
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_101636.png]]
   and better control
   of your agenda's appearance.
   #+CAPTION: Org Mode 9.5 - orgmode.org/Changes.html

   to use Org to manage a knowledgebase,
   #+CAPTION: Org Roam UI - github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui/

   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_102028.png]]
   New Magit major release!
   Jonas Bernoulli has split some functionality
   into other packages so that
   Emacs Lisp developers can use them, such as
   magit-section, transient, and forge.
   #+CAPTION: (and Bufler Taxy Magit-Section) - www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/pkuwcq

   [[file:images/minibuffer-interaction-paradigm.png]]
   In terms of smaller packages, there's been

   Karthik has a great diagram,
   #+CAPTION: Default Emacs completion and extras - https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-01-06-emacs-default-completion/
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211024_165646.png]]
   and Prot explains how things work together.
   I think the idea is that instead of having
   one large completion system
   like Helm or Icicles, you can choose
   a few different, smaller packages
   and configure them to work together.
   If you're curious about this, 
   you might start with either
   #+CAPTION: selectrum - github.com/raxod502/selectrum

   selectrum 
   #+CAPTION: Vertico - github.com/minad/vertico
   [[file:images/vertico.svg]]
   or vertico,
   which are both completion interfaces,
   #+CAPTION: marginalia - github.com/minad/marginalia
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212130.png]]
   add marginalia for more information,
   #+CAPTION: consult - github.com/minad/consult

   #+CAPTION: On completion frameworks - www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ppg98f

   that work on things in buffers, minibuffer content,
   and even collections of things.
   You can also use it
   when you start doing one command
   and then decide to do a different one instead.

   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211022_171008.png]]
   Now that there are Emacs Lisp bindings 
   for tree-sitter, we can work more easily
   with the structure of code instead of 
   just using regular expressions.
   Check out the talk
   on Tree-edit and structural editing
   to learn more.

   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_212756.png]]
   You can use tree-sitter for
   intelligent snippets that get information 
   from the code around them,
   #+CAPTION: github.com/polaris64/symex-ts
   [[file:images/Screenshot_20211020_213017.png]]
   editing Lisp expressions, 
   #+CAPTION: github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter
   [[file:images/evil-textobj.gif]]
   and navigating text objects in Evil mode. 
   (That's when Emacs is pretending to be Vi.) 
   Dynamic modules help us add more to Emacs 
   than Emacs Lisp easily offers,
   #+CAPTION: GopCaml - www.youtube.com/watch?v=KipRuiLXYEo

   Collaborative editing is now much easier 
   since the CRDT package is in GNU ELPA. (Reddit) 
   It allows multiple people to edit 
   the same file over the network, 
   using their own Emacs. 
   This means you can keep your own config
   and keybindings, yay!

   In case you're still under the impression 
   that Emacs is just a text editor, 
   some folks have been working on 
   pretty neat graphical experiments.
   These OpenGL bindings for Emacs Lisp 
   use an embedded xwidget,
   while other prototypes use the SVG support
   that's built into Emacs

Goal:

Srt or vtt file with subtitle copies so that I can easily replay segments, delete the ones I don't want to keep, and then use ffmpeg to collapse it into a smooth audio track.

Start recording: start OBS recording
RET Accept segment and move to next one: set end of segment, copy to other side, highlight next segment to say, unpause if needed

q Stop recording: accept current segment and then stop
Up, down Go to previous or next subtitle: cancel segment, set new beginning time
Ins Edit: cancel segment, stop recording

And then afterwards, use subed to play back different options

And then write a tool that will take the vtt and spit out the right ffmpeg command to process the webm with a black screen, audio, and subtitles, and a vtt file that's also trimmed.

And then take the images and drop them in

** Emoji support
(set-fontset-font "fontset-default" 'symbol "Noto Color Emoji" nil 'prepend)
** Waveforms

It looks like using the web interface on my phone to accept or retry segments adds too much of a delay, so I need to adjust some timestamps earlier. It might be easier to finetune timestamps if I can see the waveforms. [[https://github.com/larsmagne/wave][wave]] plots PCM data in Emacs. Maybe I can use [[https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Waveform][ffmpeg's showwavespic filter]] to show it. I think it would generally be useful to be able to see the waveform for a particular segment in a WebVTT subtitle file.

Oh hey, =my-subed-read-current-subtitle-ms-from-waveform= seems like it might work now.

* Backstory
- previous
  - Record everything, edit in Audacity, and then align afterwards in Emacs or via YouTube
  - Easiest audio editing, but time info gets lost, have to do it again afterwards. Also editing is a little mouse-heavy, but I guess that's okay
- rough outline
- filled in with top posts, review of Emacs News Highlights
- draft
- links
- wrapped at ~49 characters with help from display-fill-column-indicator-mode
- recorded audio using a hydra to capture timestamps
- keyboard sound was too loud
- web interface
- tried using Georgi keyboard, still a bit loud

- visuals
  - collecting
  - compiling
    - images
    - animated GIFs
    - speeding up videos
- burning in descriptions
- display waveforms
- buttons? but I can't seem to move the point from a button lambda.
- ugh. Next attempt: record longer segments, and then split things
  afterwards
